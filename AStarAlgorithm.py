"""
Very often, problems related to the field of artificial intelligence are abstracted as a **state space search**. The following script aims to present an informed search algorithm: **A***.

Trying to solve the following problem: finding a path between two positions on a 2D map with obstacles.

Search problems are generally abstracted with graphs. The 2D map can be seen as an undirected graph where each node corresponds to a cell on the map, and an edge connects nodes corresponding to adjacent cells.
